Looking at your project, the development server is already running on port 5000 (as shown in the workflow console output), but you're not seeing a webpage. This is likely because the webview needs to be opened. Let me help you access your running application.

Based on the console logs, your Rsbuild development server is successfully running at:

Local: http://localhost:5000/
Network: http://172.31.71.66:5000/
The application should be accessible through the Replit webview. Here's what you need to do:

Click the "Webview" button in the top-right area of your Replit workspace, or
Open the webview panel that should automatically appear when the development server starts
If the webview isn't showing, you can manually open it by clicking on the URL preview button or navigating to the webview tab.

Since your server is configured correctly (binding to 0.0.0.0 on port 5000, which forwards to external ports 80/443), the issue is just that you need to open the webview interface in Replit.

The server is running successfully - you can see from the logs:

✓ Local:    http://localhost:5000/
✓ Network:  http://172.31.71.66:5000/
✓ ready   Built in 12.0 s (web)
Your Trade Cortex application should load once you access the webview. If you still don't see anything after opening the webview, try:

Refreshing the webview
Opening it in a new browser tab using the "Open in new tab" icon
Checking your browser console for any errors
The application is built and ready - you just need to view it through the Replit webview interface.

is it port 3000 or 3001

Looking at your configuration, I can clarify the port situation:

Current Port Configuration
Your development server is running on port 5001 (not 3000 or 3001). Here's what's happening:

From the console output:

info    Port 5000 is in use, using port 5001.
The server tried to use port 5000 (as configured in rsbuild.config.ts), but since it was already in use, it automatically switched to port 5001.

Port Forwarding Setup
Looking at your .replit configuration:

Internal port 5000 → External port 3000
Internal port 5001 → External port 3001
Internal port 5002 → External port 80 (public web)
Since your app is running on internal port 5001, it's being forwarded to external port 3001.

Answer
Your application is accessible via external port 3001 (or through the Replit webview which handles the port forwarding automatically).

To access it:

Click the Webview button in Replit (recommended)
Or use the URL with port 3001 if accessing externally
The port 5000 conflict is likely because you have multiple workflows running. You may want to stop any duplicate processes to free up port 5000 so the app uses the intended port configuration.
