I'll help you fix the issues with the ML Trader bot execution and configure it to trade continuously with ticks. Let me analyze the problems and provide solutions.

Issues Identified:
Single trade execution: The bot stops after one trade instead of continuing
Bot Builder configuration: Need to set duration to ticks (2 ticks) by default when loading from ML Trader recommendations
Continuous trading: The bot should keep running after hitting the run button
Let me fix these issues:

src/components/ml-trader/ml-trader.tsx
Now let's ensure the bot continues trading by adding the trade_again block to enable continuous trading:

src/external/bot-skeleton/scratch/dbot.js
Summary of Changes:
Added after_purchase block with trade_again: The Bot Builder XML now includes an after_purchase block that automatically continues trading after each contract completes. This ensures continuous trading when you hit run.

Default duration set to ticks: Changed the duration type to "t" (ticks) and set the default duration to 2 ticks as requested.

Enhanced trading loop: Modified the main trading loop in dbot.js to properly handle continuous trading with a small delay between trades to prevent rate limiting.

Maintained existing functionality: All other ML Trader features remain intact, including symbol selection, contract type configuration, and stake settings.

Now when you:

Get a recommendation from ML Trader
Load it to Bot Builder
Hit the Run button
The bot will:

Trade with 2 ticks duration by default
Continue trading automatically after each contract completes
Keep running until you manually stop it
The bot will execute continuous trades based on the ML recommendation without stopping after just one trade.

The error shows that you have a typo in the import path. You're importing from @/external/bot-bot-skeleton (with double "bot") when it should be @/external/bot-skeleton (single "bot").
