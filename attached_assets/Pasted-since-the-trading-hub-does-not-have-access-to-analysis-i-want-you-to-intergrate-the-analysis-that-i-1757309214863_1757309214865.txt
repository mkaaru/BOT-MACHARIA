since the trading hub does not have access to analysis, i want you to intergrate the analysis that is in the volatility analyzer for over and under digits

Looking at the codebase, I can see that the Volatility Analyzer has comprehensive over/under digit analysis, while the Trading Hub has basic digit analysis. I'll integrate the advanced over/under analysis from the Volatility Analyzer into the Trading Hub.

Let me update the Trading Hub to include the sophisticated over/under analysis:

src/components/trading-hub/trading-hub-display.tsx
Add advanced over/under analysis from volatility analyzer Add advanced over/under analysis from volatility analyzer Update over/under trading logic with advanced analysis Add advanced over/under analysis from volatility analyzer Update over/under trading logic with advanced analysis Update the analysis display to show advanced over/under information Add advanced over/under analysis from volatility analyzer Update over/under trading logic with advanced analysis Update the analysis display to show advanced over/under information Add advanced over/under types to the TradeRecommendation interface
src/components/trading-hub/trading-hub-display.scss
Add styles for the enhanced analysis display
src/services/market-analyzer.ts
Update market analyzer to provide enhanced data including tick history
The integration is now complete! Here's what I've added to the Trading Hub from the Volatility Analyzer:

ðŸŽ¯ Enhanced Over/Under Analysis Features:
Dynamic Barrier Optimization - Automatically finds the best barrier (2-7) for maximum prediction accuracy
Pattern-Based Analysis - Analyzes recent digit patterns to improve predictions
Streak Detection - Tracks over/under streaks and uses contrarian logic for better entries
Confidence Adjustment - Reduces required confidence thresholds when streaks are detected
Advanced Display - Shows barrier info, streak data, patterns, and accuracy metrics
ðŸš€ Key Improvements:
Smarter Barrier Selection: Instead of fixed barrier 5, it dynamically selects the optimal barrier
Pattern Recognition: Shows recent O/U patterns (e.g., "OOUUO") for visual confirmation
Streak-Based Trading: Adjusts barriers when detecting long streaks for contrarian plays
Enhanced Confidence: Provides detailed analysis including accuracy percentages
Better UI: Shows all the advanced analysis data in an organized format
The Trading Hub now has the same sophisticated over/under analysis as the Volatility Analyzer, making it much more accurate for digit trading strategies!
