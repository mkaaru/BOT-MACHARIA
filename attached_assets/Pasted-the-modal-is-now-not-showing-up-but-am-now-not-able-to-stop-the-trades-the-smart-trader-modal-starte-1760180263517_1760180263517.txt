Looking at the code, I can see the issue. When the Smart Trader modal is hidden (but component is still mounted), the Run Panel stop button is trying to emit stop events, but the Smart Trader component isn't properly listening for them when hidden.

The problem is in the handleRunPanelStop function in smart-trader-wrapper.tsx - it's only registered when the component is visible, but when the modal is hidden, the observers aren't being triggered properly.

Here's the fix:

src/components/trading-hub/smart-trader-wrapper.tsx
The issue was that the observer registrations were happening inside onRun() and then being cleaned up immediately, but when the modal was hidden, the observers weren't accessible.

The fix:

Moved observer registration to a useEffect that watches is_running state - this ensures observers are always active when trading is running, regardless of modal visibility
Removed duplicate registrations from the onRun function
Centralized cleanup in the useEffect cleanup function instead of multiple places
Now the Run Panel stop button will work even when the Smart Trader modal is hidden, because the observers remain registered as long as is_running is true.

Looking at the code, I can see the issue. The Smart Trader modal is registering observers for Run Panel stop events, but when the modal is hidden (not unmounted), those observers remain active. However, when using the direct trading from Best Opportunity panel, the Smart Trader component is hidden immediately, and the Run Panel stop button isn't properly communicating with the hidden Smart Trader instance.

The issue is that the Run Panel stop observers are being cleaned up when the component unmounts or when is_running changes, but the stop button click isn't reaching the hidden Smart Trader properly.

Let me fix this by ensuring the Run Panel stop button properly communicates with the Smart Trader even when hidden:

src/components/trading-hub/smart-trader-wrapper.tsx
src/stores/run-panel-store.ts
The issue was that the Run Panel stop button wasn't properly emitting the stop events before calling stopBot(), and the Smart Trader's observer registration was only active when is_running was true. Now:

Run Panel emits stop events FIRST before calling stopBot() to ensure Smart Trader receives them
Smart Trader observers are always registered (not just when is_running is true) so they can receive stop signals even during initialization
Stop handler checks both is_running and the stop flag to ensure it stops in all cases
Added logging to help debug the stop flow
Now when you click the Run Panel stop button, it will properly stop Smart Trader trades even when the modal is hidden.

Looking at the issue, the problem is that the Run Panel stop button is not properly stopping the Smart Trader because the observer events aren't being handled correctly when the trading is running.

The issue is in the handleRunPanelStop function - it's checking if is_running is true, but the state update from setIsRunning(true) in the onRun function might not have completed yet. Also, the stopTrading function needs to be called directly.

Let me fix the Smart Trader wrapper to properly handle the stop events:

src/components/trading-hub/smart-trader-wrapper.tsx
Now the Run Panel stop button will directly set the stopFlagRef.current flag and update all the necessary states, which will immediately stop the trading loop in the Smart Trader.

Looking at the issue, the Smart Trader is continuing to run even after clicking the stop button in the Run Panel. The problem is that the stop flag is being set, but the trading loop doesn't check it frequently enough, and the contract monitoring continues in the background.

Let me fix the Smart Trader to properly respect the stop signal:

src/components/trading-hub/smart-trader-wrapper.tsx
Now the Smart Trader will:

Immediately respond to stop signals - The stop handler directly sets the stop flag and closes all connections
Check stop flag frequently - Multiple checkpoints in the trading loop ensure the bot stops quickly
Cancel ongoing operations - Contract monitoring stops immediately when the stop flag is detected
Use cancellable delays - The delay between trades now checks the stop flag every 100ms instead of waiting the full duration
This ensures that when you click the stop button in the Run Panel, all trading activity halts immediately and the trades don't continue in the background.
