Your code has a structural issueâ€”it mixes JavaScript logic with Blockly XML (a visual programming tool). This causes confusion because:

The JavaScript part (top) is correct and implements martingale properly:

Handles losses by doubling the bet (newMultiplier = martingaleMultiplier * 2).

Resets on wins or after hitting maxMultiplier/maxConsecutiveLosses.

Logs changes clearly (ðŸ”´ LOSS: Martingale applied...).

The Blockly XML part (bottom) is redundant and conflicts with the JavaScript logic:

It tries to re-implement the same martingale logic but in a visual programming format.

If both are active, they might override each other, causing unexpected behavior.

ðŸ”§ How to Fix This
Option 1: Use Only JavaScript (Recommended)
Delete the Blockly XML and rely on your JavaScript logic, which is already correct.
Advantages:

Cleaner, easier to debug.

No risk of conflicting logic.

Option 2: Use Only Blockly (If Required)
If you must use Blockly:

Remove the JavaScript martingale logic (keep only trade execution).

Ensure the Blockly blocks match the logic:

On win: Reset multiplier to 1.

On loss: Double the multiplier (with safety checks).

ðŸš¨ Critical Issues in Current Implementation
Mixed Execution
If both JavaScript and Blockly run, the multiplier might be:

Doubled by JavaScript â†’ then reset by Blockly (or vice versa).
â†’ Result: Martingale fails.

Missing Base Amount in Blockly
The Blockly XML doesnâ€™t reference baseAmount, so it canâ€™t calculate the new bet size correctly.

No Max Limits in Blockly
The Blockly logic doesnâ€™t enforce maxMultiplier or maxConsecutiveLosses, risking infinite bet increases.

âœ… Corrected Blockly Implementation (If Used)
Add these blocks to enforce safety limits:

xml
<!-- On Loss: Double multiplier (with max check) -->

ðŸŽ¯ Final Recommendation
Stick to JavaScript (delete the Blockly XML).
Your JS logic is cleaner, safer, and already works for martingale.

If Blockly is mandatory:

Remove the JavaScript martingale logic.

Add the corrected Blockly blocks (above) with max limits and base amount support.

Test Thoroughly
Verify the multiplier updates correctly after each trade:

javascript
console.log("Current Multiplier:", martingaleMultiplier, "| Next Bet:", this.tradeOptions.amount);
Expected Output After Fix (JavaScript Version)
Trade	Result	Multiplier	Next Bet
1	Win	1x	0.50 USD
2	Loss	2x	1.00 USD
3	Loss	4x	2.00 USD
4	Loss	8x	4.00 USD
5	Win	Reset to 1x	0.50 USD
Your current JavaScript code already does thisâ€”just remove the Blockly XML conflict. ðŸš€
