 here's a detailed explanation of how the Auto Over/Under and Auto O5U4 strategies work:

Trading Hub Auto Strategies Detailed Explanation
Auto Over/Under Strategy
This strategy uses advanced AI pattern recognition to analyze market data and recommend optimal over/under positions.

How it works:

Market Analysis: The system analyzes tick data from multiple volatility indices (R_10, R_25, R_50, R_75, R_100, RDBEAR, RDBULL, 1HZ10V, 1HZ25V, 1HZ50V, 1HZ75V, 1HZ100V)

Pattern Recognition: It tracks the last digit of each tick price and builds statistical models to identify patterns:

Counts frequency of each digit (0-9)
Identifies the most frequent digit in recent history
Analyzes current last digit vs historical patterns
AI Recommendation Logic:

UNDER 7: Recommended when most frequent digit is low (0,1,2) AND current last digit is high (7,8,9)
OVER 2: Recommended when most frequent digit is high (7,8,9) AND current last digit is low (0,1,2)
Trade Execution:

Places either "Digit Over 2" or "Digit Under 7" contracts
Uses 1-tick duration trades
Automatically applies martingale if enabled
Auto O5U4 (Over 5 Under 4) Strategy
This is a sophisticated dual-contract strategy that simultaneously places both Over 5 AND Under 4 trades.

How it works:

Multi-Symbol Analysis: Continuously analyzes ALL 12 volatility indices simultaneously for optimal conditions

Condition Checking (All must be met):

Condition 1: Current last digit must be 4 or 5
Condition 2: The least appearing digit (in recent history) must be 4 or 5
Condition 3: The most appearing digit must be either >5 (6,7,8,9) or <4 (0,1,2,3)
Symbol Scoring: Each symbol gets a score based on:

Frequency difference between most and least appearing digits
Sample size (more data = higher confidence)
How well conditions are met
Best Symbol Selection: The system picks the symbol with the highest score among those meeting all conditions

Dual Trade Execution:

Places TWO simultaneous trades on the selected symbol:
One "Digit Over 5" contract
One "Digit Under 4" contract
Both use the same stake amount
Both have 1-tick duration
Win Condition: You win if EITHER contract wins:

If digit is 0,1,2,3,4: Under 4 wins
If digit is 6,7,8,9: Over 5 wins
If digit is 5: Both lose (only losing scenario)
Risk Management:

Uses combined martingale (doubles stake for both contracts on loss)
Resets stake when either contract wins
Circuit breakers prevent excessive losses
Key Advantages of O5U4:
High Win Probability: 80% theoretical win rate (8 out of 10 digits win)
Smart Market Selection: Always picks the best market conditions
Intelligent Timing: Only trades when statistical conditions favor success
Adaptive: Continuously monitors all markets and switches to better opportunities
Real-Time Market Analysis:
The system provides live feedback showing:

Which symbols are ready for analysis (sufficient data)
Which symbols meet trading conditions
Current best symbol with score
Market readiness status across all 12 indices
This creates a sophisticated, data-driven approach to binary options trading that maximizes win probability while minimizing risk through intelligent market selection and timing
