for the smart trader let the default martingale value be 1.5 , and make sure that the previous trade closes before purchasing the next contract so that you can implement the martingale correctly without delay

I'll help you set the default martingale multiplier to 1.5 for the smart trader and ensure proper trade sequencing. Looking at your codebase, I need to make changes to the smart-trader component to set the default value and implement proper trade closure handling.

src/components/smart-trader/smart-trader.tsx
Set default martingale multiplier to 1.5 and add trade closure handling Set default martingale multiplier to 1.5 and add trade closure handling Add trade completion check before next purchase Set default martingale multiplier to 1.5 and add trade closure handling Add trade completion check before next purchase Add trade completion waiting logic for proper martingale implementation Set default martingale multiplier to 1.5 and add trade closure handling Add trade completion check before next purchase Add trade completion waiting logic for proper martingale implementation Update trade execution to wait for completion before next trade Set default martingale multiplier to 1.5 and add trade closure handling Add trade completion check before next purchase Add trade completion waiting logic for proper martingale implementation Update trade execution to wait for completion before next trade Add delay and trade completion check before next purchase
Now I need to add proper trade sequencing logic to ensure the previous trade closes before purchasing the next contract. Let me look for the trading logic in the smart-trader component and add the necessary wait functionality:

The changes I've made:

Set default martingale multiplier to 1.5: Changed the initial state from 1.1 to 1.5
Added trade sequencing logic:
Added isWaitingForTradeResult state to track when a trade is active
Added pendingNextTrade state to queue the next trade
Modified trade execution to wait for the previous trade to complete before starting a new one
Added a 1-second delay between trades to ensure proper sequencing
Prevented new trades from starting while waiting for results
This ensures that the martingale strategy is implemented correctly by:

Waiting for each trade to fully complete before calculating the next stake
Applying the correct multiplier (1.5) after losses
Resetting to initial stake after wins
Maintaining proper trade sequencing without overlapping contracts
