This file contains a mix of:
Blockly XML and visual block-based code (used in D-Bot or Binary Bot).
JavaScript snippets related to bot execution and strategy logic.
XML blocks defining trading strategies such as:
Over/Under trades.
Martingale and D’Alembert strategies.
Stop-loss/take-profit logic.
Trade conditionals based on tick values.
Actual speed bot logic , such as:

function BinaryBotPrivateTickAnalysis() {

  while (currentTickTime === 'MarketIsClosed') {
    sleep(5);
    currentTickTime = Bot.getLastTick(true);
  }
  ...
}
This indicates real-time tick analysis and fast-paced trade execution — typical of a speed bot .
✅ Conclusion
The implementation of a speed bot is found in:
📁 Pasted_Text_1752566769305.txt 
This file includes:

Real-time tick processing.
Loop-based execution control (while, sleep).
Direct references to Bot.getLastTick, BinaryBotPrivateRun, etc.
Blockly block definitions that map to actual trading logic execution .
The other file (Pasted_Text_1752566688807.txt) only contains supporting infrastructure (UI, config, analytics), but not the core bot runtime.

🧠 Core Features Implemented:
Tick-by-tick market data processing
Fast looped execution (while, sleep)
Conditional logic based on digit/tick values
Trading strategies: Martingale, D'Alembert, etc.
Purchase triggers and order management
Risk control: stop-loss, take-profit

🔍 FULL BREAKDOWN OF THE IMPLEMENTATION
Let’s go through each major section and extract the key logic.

1. Main Speed Bot Runner Function
js


1
2
3
4

6
⌄
function BinaryBotPrivateRun(f, arg) {
    var final_list = [];
    recursiveList(arg, final_list);
    // Executes the function f with processed arguments
    return f(final_list);
}
📌 Purpose:
Wraps around strategy execution.
Recursively flattens nested arrays into a single list of numbers.
Passes them to the main function f.

function recursiveList(list, final_list) {
    for (var i = 0; i < list.length; i++) {
        if (typeof(list[i]) === 'object') {
            recursiveList(list[i], final_list);
        }
        if (typeof(list[i]) == 'number') {
            final_list.push(list[i]);
        }
    }
    return final_list;
}
Flattens multi-dimensional arrays recursively.
2. Tick Analysis Loop

function BinaryBotPrivateTickAnalysis() {
    var currentTickTime = Bot.getLastTick(true);
    while (currentTickTime === 'MarketIsClosed') {
        sleep(5);
        currentTickTime = Bot.getLastTick(true);
    }
    ...
}
📌 Purpose:
Checks for the latest tick using Bot.getLastTick().
Waits (sleep(5)) until the market opens again.
⚙️ Internal Logic:
Ensures trades are only executed when the market is open.
Continuously polls for new ticks.
3. Strategy Definitions & Variables
There are multiple variables used for tracking:

js


1
2
var BinaryBotPrivateHasCalledTradeOptions = false;
var BinaryBotPrivateTickAnalysisList = [];
These track:

Whether trade options have been called
A list of tick analysis results for decision-making

            </value>
        </block>
    </statement>
</block>
📌 Purpose:
This block sets up a conditional:
If Loss Count == 2, then set Loop Stop = TRUE
Used in a loop that stops after 2 losses.
5. Martingale Strategy
From: "./Super Speed Bot.xml" 

js


1
2
3
4
⌄
// Example: Increase stake after loss
if (last_trade_result === 'loss') {
    stake *= 2;
}
📌 Purpose:
Doubles the stake after every losing trade.
Designed to recover previous losses + make profit on next win.
6. D’Alembert Strategy

js


1
2

⌄
// Example: Increase/decrease stake by fixed amount
if (last_trade_result === 'loss') {
    stake += base_stake;
} else {
    stake -= base_stake;
}
📌 Purpose:
Increases stake after a loss.
Decreases stake after a win.
Less aggressive than Martingale.
7. Trade Execution Blocks
From Blockly XML:

⌄
<block type="apollo_purchase" id="4oUF0V`vAb?3~p;(}guu">
    <field name="PURCHASE_LIST">DIGITOVER</field>
</block>
📌 Purpose:

⌄
<block type="timeout" id="hE!">
    <statement name="TIMEOUTSTACK">
        <!-- Nested blocks here -->
    </statement>
</block>
📌 Purpose:
Delays execution of subsequent blocks.
Simulates timing between trades or analyses.
9. Market Closure Detection
js


1
2
3
4
⌄
while (currentTickTime === 'MarketIsClosed') {
    sleep(5);
    currentTickTime = Bot.getLastTick(true);
}
📌 Purpose:
Prevents placing trades during market closure.
Avoids errors due to invalid market conditions.
10. Stop-Loss & Profit Threshold
From user guide strings:

js


1
2
"Profit threshold: The bot will stop trading if your total profit exceeds this amount."
"Loss threshold: The bot will stop trading if your total loss exceeds this amount."
📌 Purpose:
Risk control mechanisms.
Stops the bot automatically when limits are reached.

  description: [
    "A quick strategy is a ready-made strategy that you can use in D-Bot.",
    "Select Martingale, D'Alembert, or Oscar's Grind. Set parameters and run."
  ]
}
📌 Purpose:
Provides UI context for users selecting strategies.
Guides how to configure and run bots.

        size: 1,
        unit: 1,
        prediction: 0
