Perfect 👍 You’re in the Deriv Bot Builder and I see the dropdown with all the trade types. Let me break each one down so you clearly know how they work 👇


---

📌 1. Up/Down

Rise/Fall type trades.

You predict whether the market will end higher (Up/Rise) or lower (Down/Fall) at the end of the contract duration compared to the entry price.

✅ Good for short-term volatility plays.



---

📌 2. Touch/No Touch

Touch → You win if the market touches a chosen target price at least once before expiry.

No Touch → You win if the market never touches the chosen target price before expiry.

✅ Best used in trending (for Touch) or ranging (for No Touch) markets.



---

📌 3. In/Out

Also called Range / Out of Range.

You set a price range:

In (Stay Between) → Price must stay inside the chosen range until expiry.

Out (Breakout) → Price must go outside the range before expiry.


✅ Works well with strong breakout or consolidation setups.



---

📌 4. Asians

Asian Up → The average price of the market over the contract is higher than entry.

Asian Down → The average price is lower than entry.

✅ Smoother than Rise/Fall, because it uses average ticks instead of just the last tick.



---

📌 5. Digits

You bet on the last digit of the market price at expiry:

Match/Differs → Predict the last digit exactly or that it won’t match.

Even/Odd → Last digit is even or odd.

Over/Under → Last digit is above or below a chosen number.


✅ Pure probability game, often used with statistics/probability strategies.



---

📌 6. Reset Call / Reset Put

Similar to Rise/Fall but with a reset feature:

Reset Call → You win if the market ends higher than entry OR higher than the lowest price during the contract (reset point).

Reset Put → You win if the market ends lower than entry OR lower than the highest price during the contract.


✅ Useful in volatile markets to increase winning chances.



---

📌 7. High/Low Ticks

You choose the contract duration (number of ticks).

High Tick → The last tick is the highest among all ticks in the contract.

Low Tick → The last tick is the lowest among all ticks.

✅ High risk/high reward, more like lottery-style betting.



---

📌 8. Only Ups / Only Downs

Predict that the market will move in one direction only for the entire contract:

Only Ups → Every tick must be higher than the previous.

Only Downs → Every tick must be lower than the previous.


✅ Very rare outcome, extremely risky but with very high payout.



---

📌 9. Multipliers

Trade with leverage (like forex/CFDs):

You can amplify your profit if the market moves in your favor.

But you also risk losing more if it moves against you.


✅ For traders who want larger exposure with smaller capital.



---

📌 10. Accumulators

Similar to multipliers but structured like a progressive growth trade:

If the market keeps moving in your favor, profit compounds each tick/step.

If it goes against you, you can lose the accumulated profit.


✅ Designed for steady trend-following strategies.
