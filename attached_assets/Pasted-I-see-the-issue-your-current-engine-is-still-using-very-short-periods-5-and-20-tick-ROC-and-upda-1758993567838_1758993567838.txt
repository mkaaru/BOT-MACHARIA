I see the issue - your current engine is still using very short periods (5 and 20 tick ROC) and updating every 30 seconds, which causes frequent signal changes. Let me create a more stable version specifically designed for Deriv Rise/Fall trading that will hold signals longer and be much more conservative about changes.Improved Trend Analysis Engine for Deriv Rise/Fall TradingCode‚ÄÇ‚àô‚ÄÇVersion 2¬†import { CandleData } from './candle-reconstruction-engine';
import { TickBasedCandleEngine, TickCandleData } from './tick-based-candle-engine';
import { EfficientHMACalculator, EfficientHMAResult, EfficientHMASlopeResult } from './efficient-hma-calcNow I've created a much more stable trend engine specifically designed for Deriv Rise/Fall trading. Here are the key improvements to prevent frequent signal changes:
üîí Signal Stability Features
1. Signal Lock System

5-minute minimum hold time - Once a signal is generated, it's locked for 5 minutes
3-minute cool-down between signal changes
2-minute update frequency (instead of 30 seconds)

2. Conservative Thresholds
typescript// Much stricter requirements
MIN_CONFIDENCE_FOR_TRADE = 75%    // (vs your original ~60%)
MIN_ALIGNMENT_SCORE = 70%         // All timeframes must align
MIN_MOMENTUM_STRENGTH = 60%       // Strong momentum required
MIN_CONFIRMATION_STREAK = 3       // Multiple confirmations needed
3. Long-term Analysis Periods
typescript// Much longer periods for stability
SHORT_ROC_PERIOD = 50 ticks   // ~5-7 minutes (vs your 5 ticks)  
MEDIUM_ROC_PERIOD = 100 ticks // ~10-12 minutes (vs your 20 ticks)
LONG_ROC_PERIOD = 200 ticks   // ~20-25 minutes (new)
4. Multi-timeframe Validation

Analyzes 5-minute, 10-minute, and 15-minute trends
Requires 70%+ alignment across all timeframes
Only trades when all periods agree

üéØ Usage for Your Deriv Bot
typescript// Initialize the stable engine
const stableEngine = new StableDerivTrendEngine();

// Process your ticks
stableEngine.processTick({
    symbol: 'R_100',
    quote: 1234.56,
    epoch: Date.now()
});

// Get trading signal (check every few minutes, not constantly)
const signal = stableEngine.getDerivSignal('R_100');

if (signal && signal.action !== 'NO_TRADE') {
    console.log(`üéØ STABLE SIGNAL: ${signal.action}`);
    console.log(`‚è±Ô∏è  Hold until: ${signal.holdUntil}`);
    console.log(`üí™ Confidence: ${signal.confidence}%`);
    console.log(`üé≤ Timeframe: ${signal.timeframe}`);
    
    // Execute trade in your Deriv bot
    // Signal is guaranteed stable for the holdUntil period
}
üõ°Ô∏è Anti-Noise Features

Signal won't change during the 5-minute hold period
Smoothing filters applied to price data before analysis
Momentum confirmation required (trend must be accelerating)
Conservative bias - defaults to NO_TRADE when uncertain
Signal age tracking - won't trade signals that are too fresh or stale

üìä Expected Behavior

Signals change maybe 2-3 times per hour maximum (instead of every few minutes)
Higher accuracy due to longer analysis periods
Better suited for 3-5 minute Deriv contracts
Clear hold periods - you know exactly when signal might change
Much less whipsawing in ranging markets

This should give you the stable, longer-term trend analysis you need for successful Deriv Rise/Fall trading!RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
