Trading Hub Replication Guide
To replicate the Trading Hub system in another app, you'll need to implement several key components and services. Here's a comprehensive guide:

Core Components Required
1. Market Analysis Service (src/services/market-analyzer.ts)
Purpose: Real-time market data analysis using WebSocket connections
Key Features:
Connects to multiple volatility indices (R_10, R_25, R_50, R_75, R_100, etc.)
Analyzes digit patterns and frequencies
Provides trading recommendations based on AI algorithms
Manages tick history (100 ticks per symbol)
2. Trading Hub Display (src/components/trading-hub/trading-hub-display.tsx)
Purpose: Main UI component with three trading strategies
Strategies Implemented:
AutoDiffer: Random digit analysis
Auto Over/Under: AI pattern recognition
Auto O5U4: Dual digit strategy (Over 5 & Under 4)
3. Symbol Analyzer (src/services/symbol-analyzer.ts)
Purpose: Tick data analysis and pattern recognition
Features: Even/odd analysis, streak detection, volatility calculations
Implementation Steps
Step 1: Set Up Market Analysis Infrastructure
WebSocket Connection Management

Connect to wss://ws.binaryws.com/websockets/v3?app_id=70827
Subscribe to tick data for all volatility indices
Implement reconnection logic
Data Processing Pipeline

Extract last digits from price quotes
Maintain rolling history of 100 ticks per symbol
Calculate digit frequencies and patterns
Step 2: Implement Trading Strategies
AutoDiffer Strategy

Random barrier selection (0-9)
Random symbol selection
Execute DIGITDIFF contracts
Auto Over/Under Strategy

Pattern analysis: Most frequent vs current last digit
Execute DIGITOVER (barrier 2) or DIGITUNDER (barrier 7)
AI-driven recommendations
Auto O5U4 Strategy

Simultaneous Over 5 and Under 4 contracts
Complex condition checking across all symbols
Win if either contract succeeds
Step 3: Risk Management System
Martingale Implementation

Automatic stake increases after losses
Reset to base stake after wins
Configurable multiplier (default 2.0)
Copy Trading Support

Multi-account execution
Real account copying for VR accounts
Token-based authentication
Step 4: UI Components
Strategy Cards

Individual toggle controls
Real-time status indicators
Configuration panels
Statistics Dashboard

Win/loss tracking
Win rate calculation
Consecutive loss monitoring
Step 5: Backend Integration
API Integration

Deriv API for contract execution
Account balance management
Contract status tracking
State Management

MobX store integration
Real-time contract updates
Session persistence

Critical Implementation Notes
Real-time Performance: The system processes market data every second and executes trades with millisecond precision
Risk Management: Implement proper stake management and loss limits
Error Handling: Robust error handling for network issues and API failures
State Synchronization: Ensure UI state matches actual contract states
Scalability: Design for multiple concurrent users and strategies
Testing Strategy
Unit Tests: Test individual strategy logic
Integration Tests: Test WebSocket connections and API calls
End-to-End Tests: Test complete trading workflows
Load Testing: Verify performance under high frequency trading
This system represents a sophisticated automated trading platform with AI-driven decision making, real-time market analysis, and advanced risk management. Ensure you have proper trading permissions and understand the financial risks before implementing.
