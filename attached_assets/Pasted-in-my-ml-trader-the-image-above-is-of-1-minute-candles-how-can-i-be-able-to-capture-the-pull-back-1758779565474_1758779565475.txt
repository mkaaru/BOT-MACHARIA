Looking at your chart, I can see you want to detect pullbacks in a bull trend and get buy recommendations when the pullback is about to reverse. I'll enhance your ML Trader to use the Ehlers Decycler for longer-term trend identification and implement a pullback detection system using at least 5 one-minute candles.

Let me update the Ehlers signal processing to better handle pullback detection:

src/services/ehlers-signal-processing.ts
Enhanced pullback detection with Ehlers Decycler for longer-term trends
Now let me enhance the trend analysis engine to work better with 5-minute candle analysis for pullback detection:

src/services/trend-analysis-engine.ts
Enhanced pullback detection using 5+ candles and Ehlers Decycler, Add pullback analysis method using Ehlers Decycler, Integrate pullback analysis with main trend analysis logic, Add pullback analysis to TrendAnalysis interface, Add pullback analysis to TrendAnalysis interface definition
Now let me add the pullback analysis method:

Now let me integrate the pullback analysis into the main trend analysis:

Now let me add the pullback analysis result to the TrendAnalysis interface:

Now let me update the TrendAnalysis interface to include pullback analysis:

Finally, let me update the ML Trader component to display pullback information:

src/components/ml-trader/ml-trader.tsx
Display pullback analysis information in ML Trader
Let me also add some CSS styling for the pullback display:

src/components/ml-trader/ml-trader.scss
Add CSS styling for pullback analysis display
I've enhanced your ML Trader with sophisticated pullback detection capabilities:

Key Features Added:
Ehlers Decycler Integration: Uses the Decycler to identify longer-term trends while filtering out short-term noise

5+ Candle Analysis: Analyzes at least 5 one-minute candles to detect pullback patterns

Pullback Detection Logic:

In bull trends: Detects when price pulls back from recent highs but stays above key support
Looks for reversal signals (green candles after pullback)
Uses Decycler to confirm the longer-term trend remains intact
Enhanced Anticipatory Signals:

Strong pullback buy signals when Decycler shows bullish trend but price is temporarily below it
Uses divergence between instantaneous trendline and Decycler to time entries
Multiple confidence levels (weak/medium/strong)
Visual Indicators: Added pullback analysis display with golden highlighting for pullback opportunities

How It Works:
Trend Identification: Uses Ehlers Decycler to determine the longer-term trend direction
Pullback Detection: Monitors for price retracements in bull trends while maintaining trend integrity
Entry Timing: Generates buy recommendations when pullbacks show reversal signs
Confirmation: Uses multiple timeframes and Ehlers signals for confirmation
The system now prioritizes pullback signals over standard signals, giving you early entry opportunities in bull trends when the pullback is about to reverse, just as shown in your chart images.
