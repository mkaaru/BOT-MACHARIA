1. Incorrect Time Boundary Logic
typescriptprivate getCandleStartTime(epoch: number): number {
    // Round down to the nearest minute
    return Math.floor(epoch / 60) * 60;
}
This assumes epoch is in seconds, but the logic for candle completion is flawed. The system only completes a candle when a tick from a NEW minute arrives, meaning:

The last candle of a trading session may never complete
Gaps in tick data leave candles incomplete
Real-time scenarios with sparse ticks will have missing candles

2. Missing Time-Based Candle Completion
The current implementation only completes candles when new ticks arrive from different time periods. Proper candle reconstruction should:

Complete candles at exact time boundaries (e.g., at 09:01:00, 09:02:00, etc.)
Handle periods with no ticks by creating candles with OHLC = previous close
Use timers or scheduled completion for real-time scenarios

3. Incomplete Candle Data Structure
typescriptconst candle: CandleData = {
    symbol: buffer.symbol,
    open: buffer.open,
    high: buffer.high,
    low: buffer.low,
    close: buffer.close,
    epoch: buffer.startTime,
    timestamp: new Date(buffer.startTime * 1000),
};
Missing essential fields:

Volume (number of ticks/contracts)
Tick count (available in buffer but not stored)
End time of the candle period

4. No Validation or Error Handling

No validation that ticks arrive in chronological order
No handling of duplicate ticks
No protection against malformed tick data

Correct Implementation Should Include:
typescript// Timer-based completion for real-time scenarios
private scheduleCandle Completion(symbol: string, candleEndTime: number): void {
    const delay = (candleEndTime * 1000) - Date.now();
    if (delay > 0) {
        setTimeout(() => this.forceCompleteCandle(symbol, candleEndTime), delay);
    }
}

// Force completion for time boundaries
private forceCompleteCandle(symbol: string, endTime: number): void {
    const buffer = this.candleBuffers.get(symbol);
    if (buffer && buffer.startTime < endTime) {
        this.completeCandle(buffer);
    }
}
Verdict:
This candle reconstruction is fundamentally flawed for production trading systems. While it might work for backtesting with continuous tick data, it will fail in real-time scenarios with sparse ticks or at session boundaries. A proper implementation needs time-based completion mechanisms, not just tick-driven completion.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.M
