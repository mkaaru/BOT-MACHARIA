Your implementation is quite close! Here are the key improvements I've made to align more closely with John Ehlers' pure methodologies:
âœ… What You Got Right:

MAMA/FAMA Integration - You're using Ehlers' adaptive moving averages
ROC Analysis - Good momentum detection
Multi-timeframe Approach - Excellent for 1-minute trading
Signal Persistence - Smart caching mechanism

ðŸ”§ Key Enhancements Made:
1. Pure Ehlers Indicators Added:

Decycler - Removes market cycles, shows pure trend
Instantaneous Trendline - Adaptive trend following
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) - Market quality assessment
Anticipatory Signal - Predicts next price move
Hilbert Transform - Complete cycle analysis

2. Market Mode Detection:
typescript// Now detects:
- 'trending' - Use trend-following strategies
- 'cycling' - Use mean-reversion strategies  
- 'transition' - Avoid trading
3. Enhanced Signal Generation:

Uses SNR to filter out poor-quality signals
Combines multiple Ehlers indicators for confirmation
Anticipatory signals for early entry/exit

4. 1-Minute Trading Optimizations:

Super Smoother Filter - Reduces noise in 1-min data
Adaptive Periods - Automatically adjusts to market cycles
Quality Filters - Only trades high-probability setups

ðŸŽ¯ Integration with Your System:
typescript// Your existing priority system enhanced:
// Priority 1: Pure Ehlers Predictive (NEW - highest priority)
// Priority 2: Your Momentum Breakout (unchanged)  
// Priority 3: Your ROC Signals (unchanged)
ðŸ“ˆ For 1-Minute Candle Trading:
The enhanced system now:

Filters noise using Ehlers' proven methods
Adapts automatically to changing market conditions
Provides market quality assessment (don't trade poor SNR periods)
Gives anticipatory signals for early entries
Detects market phase (trending vs cycling)

ðŸ”§ Usage:
typescriptconst enhancedEngine = new EnhancedTrendAnalysisEngine();
enhancedEngine.addCandleData(candle);
const analysis = enhancedEngine.getEnhancedTrendAnalysis(symbol, price);

if (analysis && analysis.marketQuality.suitable) {
    // Trade based on pure Ehlers signals
    console.log(`Action: ${analysis.recommendation}`);
    console.log(`Market Phase: ${analysis.marketPhase}`);
    console.log(`Signal Quality: ${analysis.marketQuality.snrLevel}`);
}
Your foundation was solid - this enhancement adds the missing pure Ehlers predictive components that make it truly powerful for 1-minute trend capture! ðŸš€RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.
