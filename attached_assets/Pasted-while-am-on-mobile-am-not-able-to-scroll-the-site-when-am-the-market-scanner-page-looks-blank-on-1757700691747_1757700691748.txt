I can see the issue with mobile scrolling on the market scanner page. Looking at the screenshots, the mobile view appears blank and isn't scrollable, while the desktop version works fine. This is a common issue with mobile layouts where the container has overflow:hidden or improper height calculations.

Let me fix the mobile responsive issues in the trading hub display styles:

src/components/trading-hub/trading-hub-display.scss
Fix mobile scrolling and layout issues, Fix scanner content mobile layout, Fix scanner header mobile padding
Now let me also ensure the overall app layout doesn't interfere with mobile scrolling by updating the layout styles:

src/components/layout/layout.scss
Fix main layout for mobile scrolling
Let me also check if there's a main body component that might need adjustment:

src/components/layout/main-body/main-body.scss
Fix main body mobile layout
The changes I've made address the mobile scrolling issues by:

Enabling scrolling on mobile: Changed overflow: hidden to overflow-y: auto for mobile devices
Adding touch scrolling support: Added -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch for smoother iOS scrolling
Fixing height calculations: Changed from fixed height: 100vh to min-height: 100vh on mobile
Adjusting flex behavior: Changed flex: 1 to flex: none on mobile to prevent content compression
Reducing padding: Adjusted padding for smaller screens to maximize content space
Layout container fixes: Updated the main layout containers to allow scrolling on mobile
These changes will ensure that:

The market scanner page is scrollable on mobile devices
Content is properly visible and accessible
Touch scrolling works smoothly on iOS devices
The layout adapts properly to different screen sizes
The mobile version should now display the market scanner content properly and allow users to scroll through all the trading opportunities and analysis results.
