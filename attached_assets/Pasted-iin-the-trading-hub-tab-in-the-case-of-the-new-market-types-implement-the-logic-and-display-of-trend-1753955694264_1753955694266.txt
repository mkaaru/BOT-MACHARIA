Looking at your trading hub display component and the requirements for implementing market analysis with John Ehlers' Decycler across multiple timeframes, I'll integrate the trend analysis and dashboard functionality into your existing trading hub.

I'll create a comprehensive solution that adds:

Multi-timeframe Decycler trend analysis (1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h)
Real-time trend monitoring and contract execution
Trailing stop and breakeven functionality
Integration with your existing trading hub display
src/services/decycler-analyzer.ts
Now I'll update the trading hub display to integrate this new analysis:

src/components/trading-hub-display/trading-hub-display.tsx
Now I'll add the UI components for the Decycler analysis:

Now I'll add the CSS styles for the new components:

src/components/trading-hub-display/trading-hub-display.scss
Now I'll update the main trading execution to integrate with Decycler contract monitoring:

Finally, let me create a Replit configuration file for deployment:

replit.nix
.replit
