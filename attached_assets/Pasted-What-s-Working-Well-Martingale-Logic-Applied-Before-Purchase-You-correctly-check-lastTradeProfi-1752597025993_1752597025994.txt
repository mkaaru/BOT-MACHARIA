What's Working Well:
Martingale Logic Applied Before Purchase

You correctly check lastTradeProfit and adjust the multiplier.

You track consecutiveLosses and reset on a win.

You cap the multiplier at 64x (safety measure).

Risk Management in shouldContinueTrading()

Stops trading if totalProfit exceeds thresholds.

Prevents excessive martingale (stops at multiplier >= 2).

Logging for Debugging

Helpful console.log statements for tracking martingale behavior.

⚠️ Potential Issues & Improvements:
1. shouldContinueTrading() vs. Martingale Logic Conflict
Problem:

In purchase(), you allow martingale up to 64x.

But in shouldContinueTrading(), you stop at multiplier >= 2.

This inconsistency means martingale may never go beyond 2x.

Fix:

Decide on a consistent max multiplier (e.g., 64x in both places).

Or, if you want to stop early (e.g., at 2x), adjust the logic in purchase().

2. this.tradeOptions.amount Modification
Problem:

You modify this.tradeOptions.amount directly, but:

Is this value persisted for the next trade?

If the bot restarts, does it reset to the original amount?

Fix:

Store the base amount separately and apply the multiplier dynamically.

Example:

javascript
const baseAmount = botInterface.getBaseAmount() || this.tradeOptions.amount;
this.tradeOptions.amount = baseAmount * martingaleMultiplier;
3. No Handling for lastTradeProfit === 0 (Break-even Trades)
Problem:

If lastTradeProfit === 0 (rare, but possible), the martingale state remains unchanged.

Should it reset or continue the streak?

Fix:

Decide whether to:

Reset (conservative):

javascript
if (lastTradeProfit <= 0) { /* treat as loss */ }
Ignore (neutral):

javascript
if (lastTradeProfit < 0) { /* only apply on losses */ }
4. Error in recoverFromError (Typo in 'PriceMoved')
Problem:

There's a typo in ['PriceMoved', 'InvalidContractProposal'] (should be 'PriceMoved' consistently).

Could cause unexpected behavior.

Fix:

Ensure the error list is correct:

javascript
['PriceMoved', 'InvalidContractProposal']
🔧 Suggested Improvements:
Add a maxMultiplier Config

Instead of hardcoding 64, make it configurable:

javascript
const maxMultiplier = botInterface.getMaxMartingaleMultiplier?.() || 64;
if (newMultiplier < maxMultiplier) { ... }
Reset Martingale After Max Losses

Add a maxConsecutiveLosses check:

javascript
if (newConsecutiveLosses >= 5) { // Reset after 5 losses
    botInterface.setMartingaleMultiplier(1);
    botInterface.setConsecutiveLosses(0);
}
Log More Trade Details

Helpful for debugging:

javascript
console.log(`Trade: ${contract_type} | Amount: ${this.tradeOptions.amount} | Multiplier: ${martingaleMultiplier}`);
🎯 Final Verdict:
Your implementation is mostly correct, but needs consistency (e.g., max multiplier) and edge-case handling (break-even trades).

Critical fixes needed:

Resolve the shouldContinueTrading() vs. purchase() multiplier conflict.

Ensure tradeOptions.amount is managed safely (base amount + dynamic multiplier).

Fix the PriceMoved typo.

Once these are addressed, your martingale strategy should work as expected! 🚀
