I can see your app is running on port 5002 but needs proper external port configuration. Looking at your .replit file, I can see you have port configurations but they need to be properly set up to make your app accessible.

.replit
This configuration will:

Map your running app on port 5002 to external port 80 (the default web port)
Enable exposeLocalhost to ensure the port is properly exposed
Set up other ports with unique external port numbers to avoid conflicts
Your app should now be accessible through the Replit webview at the main domain without needing a port number in the URL.

I can see the issue - there's a compilation error in your main.tsx file. The error shows that useHistory is not available in React Router v6, but your code is still trying to import and use it.

Looking at the error in the console output:

export 'useHistory' (imported as 'useHistory') was not found in 'react-router-dom'
The problem is in your main.tsx file where you're importing useHistory from react-router-dom, but in React Router v6, useHistory has been replaced with useNavigate.

Let me fix this issue:

src/pages/main/main.tsx
Replace useHistory with navigate mock object
The issue was that you were trying to use useHistory from React Router v5, but you're using React Router v6 which replaced it with useNavigate. I've fixed this by:

Removing the useHistory import
Creating a mock history object that uses the navigate function with the same interface that your Tabs component expects
This should resolve the compilation error and allow your application to load properly. The page should now display the Trading Hub and other tabs as expected.

apply the changes

I can see there's still an issue with the useHistory import in your main.tsx file. Let me fix this by removing the import and any remaining references to it:
