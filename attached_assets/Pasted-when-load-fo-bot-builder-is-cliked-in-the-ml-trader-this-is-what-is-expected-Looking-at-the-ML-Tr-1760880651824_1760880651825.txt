when load fo bot builder is cliked in the ml trader this is what is expected

Looking at the ML Trader code in src/components/ml-trader/ml-trader.tsx, I can see the bot that gets loaded when clicking "Load to Bot Builder" on a recommendation.

Yes, I can see the bot strategy that's loaded. Here's what happens:

Current ML Trader Bot Strategy
When you click "Load to Bot Builder" on a recommendation, it generates an XML strategy with these key features:

Martingale system with consecutive loss tracking
2-tick duration contracts
Stop-loss after 5 consecutive losses
Automatic stake multiplier that increases on loss and resets on win
Contract type based on recommendation:
For Step Indices: Uses CALL/PUT
For normal/1s volatilities: Uses CALLE/PUTE (Equals contracts)
The bot structure includes:

Initialization: Sets up variables for stake, max consecutive loss (5), and martingale multiplier (1)
Before Purchase: Checks if max consecutive losses reached, if so stops trading
After Purchase:
On win: Resets consecutive loss count and multiplier to 1
On loss: Increments loss count and multiplies stake by martingale value
Continues trading if under max loss threshold
The key part of the generated strategy is in the loadToBotBuilder function around lines 665-882, which creates a complete Blockly XML with:

Trade definition (market, symbol, contract type)
Duration of 2 ticks
Default stake of 0.35
Martingale logic with max 5 consecutive losses
Functions for calculating trade amounts
This is a complete, functional bot that implements risk management through the consecutive loss limit, making it safer than unlimited martingale strategies.

I understand! You want the simple martingale bot from before, not the complex one with all the tick analysis. Let me revert the "Load to Bot Builder" to the simpler version:
