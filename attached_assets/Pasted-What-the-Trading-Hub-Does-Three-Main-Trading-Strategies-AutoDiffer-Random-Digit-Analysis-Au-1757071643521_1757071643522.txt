What the Trading Hub Does:
Three Main Trading Strategies:
AutoDiffer - Random Digit Analysis

Automatically analyzes random barriers and symbols for optimal digit differ trades
Uses random barrier selection (0-9) and random symbol selection from volatility indices
Executes DIGITDIFF contracts
Auto Over/Under - AI Pattern Recognition

Uses advanced AI market analysis to identify patterns
Recommends optimal over/under positions based on digit frequency analysis
Executes DIGITOVER (barrier 2) or DIGITUNDER (barrier 7) contracts
Analyzes market data across multiple symbols to find the best trading opportunities
Auto O5U4 - Dual Digit Strategy

Simultaneously trades "Over 5" AND "Under 4" on the same symbol
Uses sophisticated analysis across all volatility indices (R_10, R_25, R_50, R_75, R_100, etc.)
Only executes when specific conditions are met:
Last digit is 4 or 5
Least appearing digit is 4 or 5
Most appearing digit is >5 or <4
Wins if either contract wins (hedged strategy)
