tick scalping on Deriv is a whole different game than normal scalping because you’re dealing with synthetic indices or Volatility / Crash & Boom markets that run 24/7 and generate ticks every ~200ms.

Here’s a structured breakdown of how you can approach tick scalping:

🔹 1. Core Idea of Tick Scalping

Instead of waiting for long candles, you use micro price movements (1–5 ticks) to capture small edges.

You’re usually aiming for a very small profit per trade but with many trades per session.

Must keep losses small and fast because tick reversals happen quickly.

🔹 2. Methods to Detect Direction
✅ (a) Simple Consecutive Tick Logic

If you see 3–5 consecutive higher ticks, probability is higher next tick = rise.

If you see 3–5 consecutive lower ticks, probability is higher next tick = fall.

Very fast, but noisy.

✅ (b) Micro-Candle Scalping

Convert ticks into 1-second or 5-tick candles.

If last 2–3 candles are bullish → scalp rise.

If last 2–3 candles are bearish → scalp fall.

Add a rule to exit quickly if opposite candle appears.

✅ (c) Indicator-Based Scalping

Run fast indicators directly on ticks or micro candles:

Hull Moving Average (HMA) → follow slope for direction.

Ehlers Decycler / MAMA → filter cycles, catch smooth short-term trend.

Rate of Change (ROC) → detect momentum bursts.

🔹 3. Entry & Exit Rules for Tick Scalping

Example playbook (5-tick trade):

Entry:

Direction confirmed by last 3–5 ticks OR micro-candle + indicator slope.

Enter immediately when trend aligns.

Exit:

Close at +1 to +3 ticks profit (you don’t aim for big moves).

Exit if 1–2 ticks go against you.

⚡ The secret is: small win, small loss, but consistent edge.

🔹 4. Risk Management

Use fixed stake per trade (not martingale if you want safety).

Limit losses per session (e.g., stop if -10 losses in a row).

Aim for many small wins, not big jackpots.

🔹 5. Example Tick Scalping Bot Flow

Pseudo-code:

ticks = get_last_ticks(10)

if last 3 ticks are higher:
    buy("rise", duration=5 ticks)
elif last 3 ticks are lower:
    buy("fall", duration=5 ticks)


Add filters:

Only trade when volatility is smooth (not spiky).

Confirm with short HMA slope.

Exit early if reversal detected.

🔹 6. Pro Tips

Tick scalping works best on Volatility 100 Index, Volatility 75, or Crash & Boom.

Avoid major spikes (check micro-candle wicks).

Use fast execution (API or Deriv Bot Builder) — don’t click manually, ticks move too fast.

Focus on probabilities, not certainty → your edge comes from consistency.

⚠️ Key difference vs normal trading:
In tick scalping, you’re not trying to predict big moves — you’re surfing the smallest waves in price.
